        <dd>Go to the Lending Services desk in the Library and ask for a 
            PIN (Personal Identification Number). 

		<p>We will enter the PIN into your record, 
            but it will be immediately encrypted so that no one, including library 
            staff, will be able to see your PIN at any time. You can change your 
            PIN at any time, and we recommend that you change the number that 
            you are first given to something that will be simple for you to remember. 
            
		<p>Once a PIN is issued, only the patron who received the PIN has access 
            to the actual number. The BHCC Library staff cannot retrieve lost 
            PINs. In the event you forget or lose your PIN, a new one can be issued 
            to you in its place. &nbsp;</dd></dl>

<b>Can I return a book to the BHCC library that I borrowed from another library such as the

Our library can send your books back as a convenience, but we run the risk of the ILL person at the home library not 
recognizing the item.  Therefore, a note with all relevant information about you, the book, and the borrowing library 
should be wrapped around the book.  As well, the note should say that you are returning the book through the BHCC Library 
via the ILL delivery truck.   We  will then make sure that the book gets to its destination and your account gets cleared.

<b>Does the library have reading software for visually impaired people?</b><dl><dd>
Yes, the library provides a software called JAWS. JAWS is a screen
reading software allowing visually impaired people to use the Internet
and other computer applications. Once it is activated on a PC, the PC
reads and narrates based on the actions of the user.</p> 

<p>On the library's ADA terminal, take the following steps to use JAWS:</p>

<ol type="1">

<li>Turn on the PC.</li>
<li>Turn on the PC speakers, below the monitor on the right.</li>
<li>Click Start, Programs, JAWS.</li>
<li>JAWS Box will open automatically, but there is no need to use this except to quit (or to practice).</li>
<li>JAWS sets &quot;hot keys&quot; to allow user navigation via the keyboard
rather than the mouse. Proficient JAWS users can manipulate the program
with ease. Beginners will be very frustrated that certain keys no
longer work properly. </li>
