PHP Homework, Spring 2014
=========================

This is some of the homework for a PHP class I took at Bunker Hill Community
College in spring 2014. Many of the files are based on exercises from the
book, *PHP and MySQL for Dynamic Web Sites: Visual QuickPro Guide (4th
Edition)* by Larry Ullman. However I did not copy any text verbatim but
typed everything myself, making sure I understood everything I typed.
